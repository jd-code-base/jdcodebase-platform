  "slug": "defanging-ip-address",
  "leetcodeId": "#1108",
  "category": "String",
  "problemStatement": "Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address. A defanged IP address replaces every '.' with '[.]' to avoid accidental linking or execution in web contexts.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "\"1.1.1.1\"",
      "output": "\"1[.]1[.]1[.]1\"",
      "explanation": "Each '.' is replaced with '[.]', so the result becomes '1[.]1[.]1[.]1'."
    },
    {
      "input": "\"255.100.50.0\"",
      "output": "\"255[.]100[.]50[.]0\"",
      "explanation": "All '.' characters in the IP are replaced with '[.]'."
    }
  ],
  "approach": "We can solve this problem in two ways. \n\n1. **Brute Force**: Loop through each character of the input string. If it's a '.', append '[.]' to the result string; otherwise, append the character itself.\n\n2. **Optimized**: Use JavaScript's built-in `replaceAll()` method to directly replace all occurrences of '.' with '[.]'. This is a clean, one-liner solution.",
  "code": "var defangIPaddr = function(address) {\n  return address.replaceAll(\".\", \"[.]\");\n};",
  "timeComplexity": "O(n), where n is the length of the input string.",
  "spaceComplexity": "O(n), for the new string being returned.",
