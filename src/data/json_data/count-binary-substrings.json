  "problemStatement": "You’re given a binary string. Your task is to count the number of substrings that:\n- Have equal number of 0s and 1s, and\n- All the 0s and all the 1s must be grouped together.\n\nNote: Repeated substrings are counted each time they occur.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "00110011",
      "output": "6",
      "explanation": "Valid substrings are: 0011, 01, 1100, 10, 0011, 01.\nWe care about both count and grouping."
    },
    {
      "input": "10101",
      "output": "4",
      "explanation": "Valid substrings are: 10, 01, 10, 01"
    }
  ],
  "approach": "Naive Approach\n1. Check all substrings and count 0s and 1s while verifying if 0s and 1s are grouped together.\n2. This results in O(n²) time complexity and is inefficient for large inputs.\n\n3. Optimized Approach\nInstead of generating all substrings, we count consecutive 0s and 1s in groups.\n1. Walk through the string character by character.\n2. Count how many times the same character repeats in a row.\n3. Store each group count in an array.\n4. For every pair of adjacent groups, take the minimum of the two.\n5. Add all such minimums to get the final result.\nThis reduces the time complexity to O(n) and uses O(n) space.",
  "code": "var countBinarySubstrings = function(s) {\n  let groups = [];\n  let count = 1;\n\n  for (let i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {\n    if (s[i] === s[i - 1]) {\n      count++;\n    } else {\n      groups.push(count);\n      count = 1;\n    }\n  }\n  groups.push(count);\n\n  let result = 0;\n  for (let i = 1; i < groups.length; i++) {\n    result += Math.min(groups[i - 1], groups[i]);\n  }\n\n  return result;\n};",
  "timeComplexity": "O(n) – One pass to count group sizes, one pass to compute result",
  "spaceComplexity": "O(n) – For storing the group sizes in an array",
