  "problemStatement": "There are n kids with candies. You're given an integer array `candies`, where `candies[i]` represents the number of candies the i-th kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, which denotes the number of extra candies you have.\n\nReturn a boolean array result of length n, where `result[i]` is true if, after giving all the extra candies to the i-th kid, they will have the greatest number of candies among all kids (or at least equal to the max).",
