  "category": ["String", "Two Pointer"],
  "problemStatement": "Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.\n\nA subsequence of a string is a new string formed by deleting some (or no) characters from the original string, without disturbing the relative order of the remaining characters.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "s = \"abc\", t = \"ahbgdc\"",
      "output": "true",
      "explanation": "\"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" appear in order in t."
    },
    {
      "input": "s = \"axc\", t = \"ahbgdc\"",
      "output": "false",
      "explanation": "\"x\" is not present in t, so s is not a subsequence."
    },
    {
      "input": "s = \"ace\", t = \"abcde\"",
      "output": "true",
      "explanation": "All characters of s appear in order in t."
    }
  ],
  "approach": "We use the **Two Pointer Technique** to efficiently traverse both strings:\n\n1. Initialize two pointers: `sIndex` for string **s** and `tIndex` for string **t**.\n2. Loop through string **t**:\n   - If `s[sIndex] === t[tIndex]`, move both pointers forward (we found a match).\n   - Otherwise, move only `tIndex`.\n3. If we reach the end of string **s**, that means all characters of **s** were found in order inside **t**. So, **s** is a subsequence of **t**.\n\nThis approach works in **O(n)** time with **O(1)** space.",
  "code": "var isSubsequence = function(s, t) {\n  let sIndex = 0;\n  let tIndex = 0;\n\n  while (tIndex < t.length) {\n    if (s[sIndex] === t[tIndex]) {\n      sIndex++;\n    }\n    tIndex++;\n  }\n\n  return sIndex === s.length;\n};\n\nconsole.log(isSubsequence(\"abc\", \"ahbgdc\")); // true\nconsole.log(isSubsequence(\"axc\", \"ahbgdc\")); // false",
  "timeComplexity": "O(n), where n is the length of string t",
  "spaceComplexity": "O(1), using just two pointers",
