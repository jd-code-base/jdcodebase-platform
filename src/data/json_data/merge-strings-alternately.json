  "problemStatement": "You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If one string is longer than the other, append the additional letters at the end of the merged string. Return the merged string.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "word1 = \"abc\", word2 = \"pqr\"",
      "output": "\"apbqcr\"",
      "explanation": "Characters are alternated: a (from word1), p (from word2), b, q, c, r."
    },
    {
      "input": "word1 = \"ab\", word2 = \"pqrs\"",
      "output": "\"apbqrs\"",
      "explanation": "After alternating a-p, b-q, word2 has extra characters r and s which are appended."
    },
    {
      "input": "word1 = \"abcd\", word2 = \"pq\"",
      "output": "\"apbqcd\"",
      "explanation": "After alternating a-p, b-q, word1 has extra characters c and d which are appended."

        "While both pointers are within bounds of `word1` and `word2`, alternately append one character from each string to the result.",
        "After the main loop, if there are any remaining characters in `word1` or `word2`, append them to the result string.",
        "Return the final merged result string."

      "code": "var mergeAlternately = function (word1, word2) {\n  let w1Index = 0;\n  let w2Index = 0;\n  let s = \"\";\n\n  while (w1Index < word1.length && w2Index < word2.length) {\n    s += word1[w1Index++];\n    s += word2[w2Index++];\n  }\n\n  while (w1Index < word1.length) {\n    s += word1[w1Index++];\n  }\n\n  while (w2Index < word2.length) {\n    s += word2[w2Index++];\n  }\n\n  return s;\n};"
