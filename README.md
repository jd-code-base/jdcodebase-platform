# 💻 JDCodebase

Welcome to the **JDCodebase** project! This is a developer-focused portfolio site built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to showcase daily **DSA problems**, clear explanations, and video tutorials. It's part of a long-term goal to create a complete coding resource hub for learners.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a clean, content-driven static website that:

- Covers **DSA problems** from scratch
- Includes **problem statements**, **examples**, **approaches**, and **code**
